For web graphics, there are two main technologies that are being used today:
* SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) : Gaining in popularity
	* Vector format. Zooming in doesn't change the quality of the thing.
	* Cons:
		   * It's slow.
		   * It doesn't play well with JQuery.
		   * It overlays directly over the DOM.
	* Pros:
		   * It DOES play very well with the CSS.
* Canvas : Most popular implementation right now
	* Non-vector format. If you zoom in, then it won't look as good.
    * it looks crappier than SVG.
	* Fast
 	* Doesn't play well with the DOM.
